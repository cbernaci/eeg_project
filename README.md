I am building my own EEG system for neurofeedback (NFBK) purposes. 
I want to learn about brain frequencies and which patterns correlate to different symptoms
I want to create my own neurofeedback system, maybe based on free YouTube videos that i can
ammend for my own NFBK treatment. 

This project will contains just the EEG portion of the system and include:
=> reading, amplification, filtering, and digitization of voltages from scalp using electrodes, breadboard, and microcontroller
=> serial reading of digital data from microcontroller to Macbook M3
=> digital signal processing of signals on Macbook M3
=> plotting and visualization of signals in Metal and ImGui based GUI

This project is designed to run on a Macbook M3 Pro and so I am using Apple Developer tools
to get the most out of the M3 Pro chip.

# 🧠 Real-Time EEG Signal Processing System (C)

This project implements a modular real-time EEG signal acquisition and processing system in C, designed to communicate with a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) via serial and perform signal processing and visualization on a MacBook.
